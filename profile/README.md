# Quranfi Project

🌙 **Quranfi** is a cross-platform, open-source initiative focused on making the Qur'an and Duas more accessible through clean, fast, and modern tools — all developed with students and everyday users in mind.

This repository serves as the central hub for all Quranify-related subprojects, including frontend apps and API services.
